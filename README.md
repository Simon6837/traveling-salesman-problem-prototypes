## Traveling salesman problem(Tsp)

This repository contains the Java prototypes for the TSP algoritms for our warehous robot

We have the following algoritms

		Brute Force
		Nearest neighbour
		farthest insertion
		2-opt
  
By editing the distance matrix we can run various datasets.
When you run the program all the algoritms will get called in the main function.
It then displays the runtime and the route for each algoritm in the console
